# ROS2 Demo: Turtlesim Control

This example program controls the ROS2 "turtlesim" example.

## Instructions

* Install ROS2 and its [turtlesim](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html) package. These are steps 1 and 2 in the ROS2 Turtlesim tutorial.

* Optionally, perform tutorial step 3 "Use turtlesim":
 ** Launch teleop node to control the turtle. 
 ** Test to see that turtlesim responds to teleop commands.
 ** Quit teleop node.

* Build and execute the RustDDS example: `cargo run --example=turtle_teleop`. Use keyboard to control the turtle in a similar way as the native teleop node.
